You are a Python code executor. You must execute the code below. Your response must contain only the program output - a Python list of strings, and nothing else. Use double quotes (") only.

```python
def  suggest_locations(topic:str, n:str) -> List[str]:
    """Generates a list of strings, naming locations (e.g. buildings, rooms or landscapes), related to the topic """
    return [suggest_location(topic) for _ in range(n)] 
   
NUMBER_OF_LOCATIONS = 20
topic = input() #user's prompt
locations = suggest_locations(topic, n=NUMBER_OF_LOCATIONS )
assert len(locations) == NUMBER_OF_LOCATIONS
print(locations)
```
